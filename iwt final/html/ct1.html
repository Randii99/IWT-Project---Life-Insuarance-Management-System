                 Buying life insurance is important, and we’re here for you every step of the way.
                    Learn what to keep in mind when purchasing coverage to protect your family.
    
                Life insurance provides financial protection for your loved ones through a tax-free lump sum of money, 
                called the death benefit , paid to your designated beneficiary when you die.You can customize your policy
                to fit your family’s needs by choosing the type of policy you buy, the number of years you want it to last,<br>
                your coverage amount, and which company you’d like a policy with. If you die while your life insurance policy is active,
                your beneficiaries can file a claim and the death benefit will be paid out to them.
              
                Life insurance coverage offers affordable financial protection—and invaluable peace of
                mind—if your family members rely on you. The death benefit can be used to pay for expenses like a mortgage, 
                utility and grocery bills, children's college costs, final funeral arrangements, long-term care, and more.

                 Term life insurance lasts for a number of years before it expires. If you die before the term is up, a set amount of money, 
                 known as the death benefit, is paid to your designated beneficiary. Term insurance is considered the simplest, most  accessible life insurance policy.
                 When you make your payments (known as your premiums), you’re paying for the death benefit that will go to your beneficiaries when you are gone. 
                 The death benefit can be paid out as a lump sum, a monthly payment, or an annuity. Most people elect to receive their death benefit as a lump sum.
                 Term life insurance policies are more affordable than other types of life insurance policies and generally have lower premium costs. 
                 The average monthly premium payment for a 20-year, rs500,0000 policy for a healthy 35-year-old female is 1224.48.
                 Methodology: Rate is calculated for a female non-smoker with a Preferred health rating based in Ohio; 
                 Life insurance averages are based on a composite of policies offered by Policygenius from
                 AIG, Banner, Brighthouse, Lincoln, Mutual of Omaha, Pacific Life, Principal, Protective, 
                 Prudential, SBLI, and Transamerica and may vary by insurer, term, coverage amount, health class,
                 and state. Not all policies are available in all states. Rate illustration valid as of 1/11/2021.

        <h4 class="whlh"> <b><u><i>Whole Life Insurance</i></u></b> </h4>

        <div class="whl">
   
                 Whole life insurance, on the other hand, is a type of permanent life insurance because it does not expire. It has a death benefit and a cash value,
                 which is an investment-like, tax-deferred savings account that is included in the policy. The cash value accrues interest at a predetermined fixed rate. 
                 Each month, a certain portion of your premium will go into the cash value of the policy, which offers a guaranteed rate of return (the exact amount that 
                 goes into savings is determined by your individual policy). The policy's cash value grows over time and can be withdrawn when it accumulates enough value
                 or is used for a loan.
                 A whole life insurance policy can cost five to 15 times as much as a term life policy for the same death benefit amount, according to Policygenius data in 
                 January 2021.
                 Whole life offers lifetime coverage as long as you pay the premiums. However, the cash value component makes whole life more complex than term life because
                 of surrender fees, taxes, interest, and other stipulations.
                 Whole life insurance may be worthwhile if you need the cash value to cover things like endowments or estate plans, or if you have long-term dependents such 
                 as children with disabilities.
